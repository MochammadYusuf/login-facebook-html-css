          <span>But what about the roads?</span>
          You just don't understand economics, like supply and demand. Don't
          worry kiddo, where there's a demand there will be a supply; we'll all
          have our roads.

        <li>
          <span>Is taxation theft></span>
          If I came to your house with some heavily armed buddies, demanded that
          you and your neighbors give me a percentage of your income, in return
          for some crappy monopolized services that you didn't ask for, would
          you consider that theft?

        <li>
          <span>So, what you are saying, ......</span>
          Libertarians want to live in a world where gay couples can protect
          their poppy fields with fully automatic weapons. A world where
          voluntaryism and property rights are treated with the highest respect.
